## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Through this project, I am gaining experience in HTML and CSS. I have tried to ensure the paddings, alignments, and all the elements consistent to ensure that the design remains consistent. I tried to make the code structure more cleaner and understandable as to what classes and elements are there so that whenever I go back, I can see where the issue is occuring.
